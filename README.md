# Hotel-Management-System
The Hotel Management System is a comprehensive solution designed to streamline and automate customer check-in, check-out, and room management processes. This project focuses on creating user-friendly interfaces and robust backend functionalities to ensure efficient hotel operations. Key features include smooth customer check-in and check-out processes, efficient room assignment and status updates, accurate billing calculations, and a reliable bill printing module. The system utilizes a MySQL database with essential tables such as customer, logininfo, and rooms to ensure seamless data management and integration with existing systems for a cohesive user experience.

As the lead developer, I was responsible for designing and implementing both frontend and backend functionalities, crafting the MySQL database, and authoring crucial sections of the project report, including the introduction, standards adopted, and requirement specifications. Additionally, I developed comprehensive class diagrams and data flow diagrams (DFDs) to illustrate the system's architecture and processes. Working closely with team members, I ensured smooth feature integration and conducted rigorous testing and debugging to guarantee the system's robustness and reliability.

Throughout this project, I enhanced my skills in software development, database management, system design, and collaboration. I gained proficiency in frontend and backend technologies, improved my ability to design and manage databases, and refined my problem-solving skills through extensive testing and debugging. This project also provided valuable experience in project management and the software development lifecycle, preparing me for future challenges in the field.

To get started with the project, clone the repository from GitHub, navigate to the project directory, install the necessary dependencies, set up the MySQL database using the provided SQL script, and start the application. Users can navigate through the check-in and check-out pages, manage room statuses, and generate bills through the billing module.
